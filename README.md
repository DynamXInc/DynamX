<h1 align="center">DynamX - Realistic Physics for Minecraft</h1>

<p align="center">
    Welcome to the official repository of DynamX, a Minecraft mod that adds realistic physics into the game. With DynamX, you can add vehicles, props, ragdolls, blocks, and armor into your game, all of which follow the laws of physics and come with highly detailed models.
</p>

## üõ† Creating an Add-on

Interested in creating an add-on for DynamX? You can find a step-by-step guide on how to make add-ons [here](https://dynamx.fr/wiki/installation/devsetup/).

Include the following in your `build.gradle` to set up your workspace:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://maven.dynamx.fr/artifactory/DynamXRepo'
    }
    maven {
        url 'https://maven.dynamx.fr/artifactory/ACsGuisRepo'
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "fr.dynamx:DynamX:[VERSION]"
    implementation "fr.aym.acsguis:ACsGuis:1.2.9"
}
```

After this, add DynamX to your `mods` folder.

## üåü Contributing to DynamX

To contribute to DynamX, reload the Gradle project to set up the workspace. To run your game with the DynamX core mod, add the following line to the VM options of the run configuration in your IDE:

```
